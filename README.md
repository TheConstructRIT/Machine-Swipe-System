# Machine Swipe System
The goal of the machine swipe system is to improve
the management of access to large-scale machines.
The system can be configured to be able to restrict
access to trained individuals, as well as log usage
and automatically stop machines when unattended. The
system was designed for [The Construct at RIT](http://hack.rit.edu/).
